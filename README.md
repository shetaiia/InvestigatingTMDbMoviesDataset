This dataset comes from IMDb and contains information about 10,000 movies, short films, and TV series collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings, revenue,
runtime, and budget. In this project, I answered the following questions using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn:

- What month is considered "best" for releasing a film/show?
- What is the relationship between runtime and vote average?
- What genres are associated with films/shows that have high revenues?
- What percentage do the top 5 genres make up?
